### Hi, Iâ€™m Tristan (AKA @ShortCirc8)
I'm a professional software developer, currently working with  enterprise Java, but dabble (professionally) with a bit of everything
I'm talking:
- React
- HTML/css
- Java (duh!)
- JS
- SQL (MSSQL/MYSQL)

As much as those all interest me I also like to play around with any and all new services/languages/etc. Currently i'm playing around with: 
- Kotlin (such a fun language)
- Typescript
- bash/zsh
- linux (currently fedora, but who knows in a week). 

I'm considering dipping my feet into open source contribution, and any thing that uses these technologies would be projects I'd be looking to contribute to.
